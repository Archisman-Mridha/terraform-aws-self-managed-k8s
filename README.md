# Self managed K8s in AWS Terraform module

> This Terraform module creates a self-managed Kubernetes cluster in AWS. Don't use this for production purposes!

You can view this module in the Terraform registry here - https://registry.terraform.io/modules/Archisman-Mridha/self-managed-k8s/aws/latest.

It takes a list of availability zones (AZs) from the user and creates a public subnet in each AZ. A master node is bootstrapped in the first subnet. Then, a worker node is bootstrapped in each of the public subnets. It uses **Kubeadm** behind the scenes, to bootstrap the Kubernetes cluster.

Inside the module, an **outputs** folder is created. The outputs folder contains -

- *kubeconfig.yaml* file.
- *kubeadm-join.sh* script which contains the kubeadm join command.
- *private-key.pem* file which contains the private key required to SSH into the nodes.

## Limitations

Currently, this module is not flexible at all. Here are the limitations -

- Only a single master node is created.
- All nodes are provisioned in public subnets.
- Ubuntu is the only supported OS.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Support high availability mode (multiple master nodes)
- [ ] Write E2E tests using Terratest.
- [ ] Provision all the nodes in private subnets.
